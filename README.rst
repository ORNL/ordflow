Python interface to ORNL's `DataFlow <https://dataflow.ornl.gov>`_

DataFlow is a software and networking solution that allows movement of scientific measurement data from (often) airgapped (off-network) scientific instruments to an accessible filesystem.
DataFlow is available through a web-interface as well as a REST API. 
This package provides a user-friendly pythonic wrapper to DataFlow's REST API.
